/*
The first useful table within ReportServer is dbo.Catalog.  This table contains 1 row for every object found on the SSRS site.  This includes a row for each folder, report, data source, image, and linked report.  The primary key and clustered index for the table is ItemID and it is a GUID.  The user columns are also a GUID and can be converted to a name by joining to the dbo.Users table.
Depending on the version of SSRS not all type values may be available.
